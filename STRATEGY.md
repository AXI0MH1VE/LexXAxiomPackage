# AxiomHive: Operational Strategy

## Vision

To build a sovereign, local-first, and verifiable software ecosystem. Our tools empower individuals and teams to operate with full control over their data and computational environment, free from external dependencies and opaque supply chains. We achieve this through deterministic builds, cryptographic integrity, and an offline-by-default design philosophy.

## Concrete Deliverables (Running Today)

The AxiomHive starter stack provides the following verifiable components:

1.  **AxiomHash v2.0:** A command-line tool for high-performance, streaming file hashing (`sha256`, `blake3`) with a verifiable Merkle root stub. It provides constant-time comparison for secure integrity checks.
2.  **AxiomSSI v1.0:** A command-line tool for Sovereign Self-Identity. It manages local `ed25519` keypairs in a secure keystore, enabling users to create identities, sign files, and verify signatures without reliance on any external authority.
3.  **RuntimeZero:** A local installer that sets up a sandboxed environment for all AxiomHive tools, ensuring dependencies are pinned and execution is isolated.
4.  **GeminiPortable:** A CLI wrapper with a local-first 4D memory system and a deterministic stub for an LLM backend, demonstrating the architecture for sovereign generative AI.
5.  **Athena Engine:** A narrative generation tool stub with operational ethical guardrails, including policy enforcement and cryptographic watermarking.
6.  **Tesseract Orchestrator:** A skeleton orchestrator that correctly wires together the Athena (narrative) and Agora (metrics) modules, with explicit no-op boundaries for other planned components.
