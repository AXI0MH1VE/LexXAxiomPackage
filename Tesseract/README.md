# Tesseract Orchestrator: AxiomHive Integration Hub

Tesseract Orchestrator is the integration hub of the AxiomHive ecosystem. It's a skeleton orchestrator designed to correctly wire together various AxiomHive modules, such as Athena (narrative generation) and Agora (metrics). Tesseract emphasizes explicit no-op boundaries for other planned components, ensuring a modular and extensible architecture that adheres to AxiomHive's principles of **Determinism (H=0)** and **Verifiable Integrity**.

## Features (Skeleton Implementation)

*   **Modular Integration:** Designed to connect and orchestrate different AxiomHive modules.
*   **Explicit No-Op Boundaries:** Clearly defined interfaces for future module integration.
*   **Core Wire-up:** Demonstrates the basic wiring between Athena and Agora modules.

## Installation

To install Tesseract, ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher. It's recommended to install it within the AxiomHive `RuntimeZero` environment.

```bash
# From the axiomhive root directory
cd Tesseract
pip install -e .
```

## Usage (Conceptual)

*(Note: As a skeleton, Tesseract's current functionality is primarily illustrative of its architectural role within AxiomHive. Its full orchestration capabilities will be realized as more modules are developed.)*

### Running the Orchestrator (Stub)

```bash
tesseract run
```

## AxiomHive Principles

Tesseract adheres to the core AxiomHive principles:

*   **Determinism (H=0):** Reproducible builds and operations.
*   **Sovereignty (Local-First):** Operates offline, no external dependencies.
*   **Verifiable Integrity:** Cryptographic proof for trust.
*   **Ethics-by-Default:** No telemetry, secure by design.
*   **Offline-First:** Default operational mode is disconnected.
