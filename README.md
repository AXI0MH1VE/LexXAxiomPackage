# AxiomHive: Sovereign, Local-First, Verifiable Software Ecosystem

![AxiomHive Logo Placeholder](docs/img/axiomhive_logo.png)

Welcome to AxiomHive, a pioneering software ecosystem built on the principles of **Determinism (H=0)**, **Sovereignty (Local-First)**, **Verifiable Integrity**, **Ethics-by-Default**, and **Offline-First**. Our mission is to empower individuals and teams with absolute control over their data and computational environment, free from external dependencies and opaque supply chains.

## Vision

To create a resilient, private, and auditable digital infrastructure where trust is established through cryptographic proof, not promises. AxiomHive provides the foundational tools for a new era of sovereign computing.

## Core Principles

*   **Determinism (H=0):** Reproducible builds and operations.
*   **Sovereignty (Local-First):** Absolute user control, offline by default.
*   **Verifiable Integrity:** Cryptographic proof for all critical artifacts.
*   **Ethics-by-Default:** Built-in safeguards, no opt-out telemetry.
*   **Offline-First:** Resilient and private operation without network reliance.

For a detailed explanation of our principles, please refer to [PRINCIPLES.md](PRINCIPLES.md).

## Components of the AxiomHive Starter Stack

The AxiomHive starter stack includes the following verifiable components, each designed with our core principles in mind:

1.  **[AxiomHash](AxiomHash/README.md):** A command-line tool for high-performance, streaming file hashing with Merkle root support, ensuring data integrity.
2.  **[AxiomSSI](AxiomSSI/README.md):** A tool for Sovereign Self-Identity, managing local cryptographic keypairs for digital signing and verification.
3.  **[RuntimeZero](RuntimeZero/README.md):** Our local installer, setting up a sandboxed environment for all AxiomHive tools with pinned, verifiable dependencies.
4.  **[GeminiPortable](GeminiPortable/README.md):** A CLI wrapper demonstrating sovereign generative AI with a local-first 4D memory system and deterministic LLM stub.
5.  **[Athena Engine](Athena/README.md):** A narrative generation tool stub with operational ethical guardrails, including policy enforcement and cryptographic watermarking.
6.  **[Tesseract Orchestrator](Tesseract/README.md):** A skeleton orchestrator that wires together AxiomHive modules, ensuring modularity and extensibility.
