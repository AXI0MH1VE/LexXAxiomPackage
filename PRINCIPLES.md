# AxiomHive: Core Principles

These five principles guide all development within the AxiomHive ecosystem.

1.  **Determinism (H=0):** Every build and every operation must be reproducible. Given the same inputs, the system must produce the exact same outputs. We achieve this through pinned dependencies, lock files, and deterministic algorithms. Entropy is an adversary.

2.  **Sovereignty (Local-First):** The user must have absolute control. All tools are designed to run offline by default, with zero reliance on external networks, servers, or services. Data and keys remain on the user's machine, always.

3.  **Verifiable Integrity:** Trust is established through cryptographic proof, not promises. All critical artifacts, source code, and outputs can be hashed, signed, and verified. The system's integrity is auditable by anyone at any time.

4.  **Ethics-by-Default:** Systems must be designed with safeguards from the ground up. Telemetry is opt-in only and disabled by default. Generative tools must include policy guardrails, watermarking, and signing to ensure responsible use and provenance.

5.  **Offline-First:** The default operational mode is disconnected. Network connectivity is treated as an optional, explicitly enabled enhancement, not a requirement. This ensures resilience, privacy, and sovereignty.
