# Athena Engine: Narrative Generation with Ethical Guardrails

Athena Engine is a narrative generation tool stub within the AxiomHive ecosystem, designed with operational ethical guardrails from the ground up. It demonstrates how to integrate policy enforcement and cryptographic watermarking into generative AI processes, embodying the principle of **Ethics-by-Default**. Athena aims to ensure responsible use and verifiable provenance for generated content.

## Features (Stub Implementation)

*   **Policy Enforcement:** Conceptual framework for applying ethical policies to narrative generation.
*   **Cryptographic Watermarking:** Placeholder for embedding verifiable watermarks into generated content.
*   **Modular Design:** Designed to integrate with other AxiomHive components like AxiomSSI for signing generated content.

## Installation

To install Athena, ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher. It's recommended to install it within the AxiomHive `RuntimeZero` environment.

```bash
# From the axiomhive root directory
cd Athena
pip install -e .
```

## Usage (Conceptual)

*(Note: As a stub, Athena's current functionality is primarily illustrative of its architectural role within AxiomHive. Full narrative generation capabilities would be integrated in future development.)*

### Running the CLI (Stub)

```bash
athena generate --prompt "A story about a sovereign AI."
```

### Policy Application (Conceptual)

```python
# Example of how policy might be applied programmatically
from athena.policy import NarrativePolicy
policy = NarrativePolicy()
# ... apply policy to generated content ...
```

## AxiomHive Principles

Athena adheres to the core AxiomHive principles:

*   **Determinism (H=0):** Reproducible builds and operations.
*   **Sovereignty (Local-First):** Operates offline, no external dependencies.
*   **Verifiable Integrity:** Cryptographic proof for trust.
*   **Ethics-by-Default:** No telemetry, secure by design.
*   **Offline-First:** Default operational mode is disconnected.
